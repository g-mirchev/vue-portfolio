            This course opened my eyes to the various possibilities that the
            world of computer science has to offer. It sparked my passion for
            object oriented programming, game and web development. These years
            gave me the knowledge I needed to start my career as a software / web
            developer as well as the oportunity to meet and work with like-minded
            individuals.
